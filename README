This is a general purpose android application to monitor you mining pool and miners as well.

People who use miner.php that comes with cgMiner will find this app especially useful as it 
provides a single interface to monitor the pool and miners from.  Keep in mind this is for 
all intents and purposes a beta test.  I have a lot of development to do still, but found
myself actually using the app last night to quickly check my pool stats and miner temps before
I went to bed.  This made me decide that it is at least ready for basic use.  Please comment
and let me know what you would like to see as far as features and any bugs you come across.

To use:

  The network stats are pulled from "http://ltc.block-explorer.com/" and is currently hard
coded into the program, this may change in the future.
  
**************************************************************************************************
  To easily access the URL needed to monitor your pool stats go to:

	My Account --> Account Details --> Click API key link
	     and copy the entire URL from the address bar.  Then in the application itself go to
 
	Options--> Settings --> API URL 
	     and paste the link there.
**************************************************************************************************
  To setup the app to monitor the miner.php just go to:

	Options--> Settings --> cgMiner API URL
		and input the URL of your cgMiner webpage.

		I would reccomend using the mobile version of miner.php as it loads best in the app
		currently, although the full versions works fine.  I have some default settings to 
		give you an example to work from.  I recommend just changing the base URL.
****************************************************************************************************

Again this is just a beta but plan to spend a lot of time and effort on this over the coming months
so any feed back is welcome.


Now what kind of miner would I be if I didn't put an address at the bottom of everything I do-
So if you like this app and wanna see it get better please feel free to donate.
